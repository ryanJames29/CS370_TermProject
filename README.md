# CS370_TermProject
CS370 (Operating Systems) Term project for the spring 2024 semester.

Project Ideas:
* Use a thermometer (sensor) and have the data transmitted through the pi to a desktop to show current household/outdoor temps.
* With the use of 2 desktops and a pi, you can have the pi be a shared server between the devices, allowing users on the server to access shared files.
* Connect both desktops to the VPN server to create a secure connection between them over the internet.
